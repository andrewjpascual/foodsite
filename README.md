## About

This is my second project involving a REST API and features some of my abilities to create a professional brochure site. With this project, I aim to create a landing page where the user can get introduced to the type of products being sold, a products page being imported from the CommerceJS API, and a shopping cart for users to purchase the wanted products.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

-  ReactJS
-  Bootstrap
-  API (CommerceJS)
-  Material UI
-  HTML / CSS

## Features

- Landing page that is responsive for all screen sizes & mobile devices:
- Products page that allows the store products to be fetched from CommerceJS
- Cart page for the user to select some products and then attempt to purchase such items 
- Functional Navbar, video hero, features some of the best products, and a footer 

## Challenges



## Inspiration

A large inspiration for this project is my desire to learn more about designing and creating professional sites with React, learning more about API's, my passion for technology, and making another fun project with another passion I am familiar with.

## To-Do

These would be my possible implementations in the future: 
  - Fixing the products page to be cleaner and better styled.
  - Fixing the card details for each product & shopping cart icon
  - Fixing the checkout page so that users could have the ability to checkout potential items
